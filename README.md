# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

A combination of XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and LASSO achieved the best performance of 0.12148 in terms of RMSE.

Focus:
- Feature analysis with respect to missing values
- Comparison of different algorithms:
 - XGBoost
 - Gradient Boosting Regressor
 - Random Forest Regressor
 - LASSO
- Model diagnostics
